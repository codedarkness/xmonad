# xmonad

Is a dynamically tiling X11 window manager that is written and configured in Haskell. In a normal WM, you spend half your time aligning and searching for windows. xmonad makes work easier, by automating this.

For more information of xmonad [here](https://xmonad.org/) and documentations [here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad).
